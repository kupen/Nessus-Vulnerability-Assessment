# Nessus-Vulnerability-Assessment

## Project Name
Scanning and Identifying Vulnerabilities with Nessus

## What is Vulnerability Scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is a test designed to determine possible security vulnerabilities in systems. Automated tools (Nessus, Nmap, Qualys, etc.) are mostly used for vulnerability scanning. In automated vulnerability scans, the main purpose is to obtain the current general security image of the tested system. Another thing that is checked in this scanning method is the compatibility processes. <br />

Examples of the most common vulnerabilities in Penetration Test Screenings:
- Websites without SSL support and simple encryption algorithms
-	Vulnerabilities in SSL encryption packages
-	Sharing files that are critical to the system
-	Accessibility of critical files in web applications
-	Default or simple password usage
-	Update gaps in operating system and applications
-	XSS Cros site scripting vulnerability
-	Deficiencies in communication infrastructure (NAC / ARP)
-	Deficiencies in security policies for the institution

## What is Nessus?
Nessus is a comprehensive vulnerability scanning software frequently used in the GNU / Linux community. It is free for personal and non-corporate use. Its general purpose is to detect potential security vulnerabilities in computer systems and computer networks.

### Some Basic Features of Nessus
-	Sensitive data discovery
-	Vulnerability analysis with browser method
-	TCP / IP issues that allow a denial of service attack
-	Detection of vulnerabilities that help hacks access sensitive data in the system
-	Identifying the most common passwords and detections on users Integration with patch method

## Why Nessus?
- Unlike other scanners, Nessus does not make assumptions about your server configuration (such as assuming that port 80 must be the only web server) that can cause other scanners to miss real vulnerabilities.
- Nessus is very extensible, providing a scripting language for you to write tests specific to your system once you become more familiar with the tool. Its also provides a plug-in interface, and many free plug-ins are available from the Nessus plug-in site.   These plugs are often specific to detecting a common virus or vulnerability. 
- Up to date information about new vulnerabilities and attacks.  The Nessus team updates the list of what vulnerabilities to check for on a daily basis in order to minimize the window between an exploit appearing in the wild, and you being able to detect it with Nessus.
- Open-source.  Nessus is open source, meaning it costs nothing, and you are free to see and modify the source as you wish.
- Patching Assistance:  When Nessus detects a vulnerability, it is also most often able to suggest the best way you can mitigate the vulnerability.

## How Nessus Works
To learn how Nessus and other port-scanning security tools work, it is necessary to understand different services (such as a web server, SMTP server, FTP server, etc) are accessed on a remote server.  Most high-level network traffic, such as email, web pages, etc reach a server via a high-level protocol that is transmitted reliably by a TCP stream.  To keep different streams from interfering with each other, a computer divides its physical connection to the network into thousands of logical paths, called ports.  So if you want to talk to a web server on a given machine, you would connect to port #80 (the standard HTTP port), but if you wanted to connect to an SMTP server on that same machine you would instead connect to port #25.   

Each computer has thousands of ports, all of which may or may not have services (ie: a server for a specific high-level protocol) listening on them.  Nessus works by testing each port on a computer, determining what service it is running, and then testing this service to make sure there are no vulnerabilities in it that could be used by a hacker to carry out a malicious attack.  Nessus is called a "remote scanner" because it does not need to be installed on a computer for it to test that computer.  Instead, you can install it on only one computer and test as many computers as you would like.

## Understanding the User Interface
### 1. Scans page
This page will allow you to create your new scans and manage them. You will also note that at the bottom left section of your screen, you have sections that allow you to configure policies that will apply to your scans, define plugin rules and monitor your scanners and agents as well. When you create a new scan or policy, a Scan Template or Policy Template appears.
