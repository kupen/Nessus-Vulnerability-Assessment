# Nessus-Vulnerability-Assessment

## Project Name
Scanning and Identifying Vulnerabilities with Nessus

## What is Vulnerability Scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is a test designed to determine possible security vulnerabilities in systems. Automated tools (Nessus, Nmap, Qualys, etc.) are mostly used for vulnerability scanning. In automated vulnerability scans, the main purpose is to obtain the current general security image of the tested system. Another thing that is checked in this scanning method is the compatibility processes. <br />

Examples of the most common vulnerabilities in Penetration Test Screenings:
- Websites without SSL support and simple encryption algorithms
-	Vulnerabilities in SSL encryption packages
-	Sharing files that are critical to the system
-	Accessibility of critical files in web applications
-	Default or simple password usage
-	Update gaps in operating system and applications
-	XSS Cros site scripting vulnerability
-	Deficiencies in communication infrastructure (NAC / ARP)
-	Deficiencies in security policies for the institution
